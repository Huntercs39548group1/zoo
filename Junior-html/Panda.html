    Pandas are a bear species endemic to China, which means they are only found in a single defined 
    geographical location, in this case China. A panda's diet mainly consists bamboo shoots and leaves. 
    In a rare case that bamboo is not available to pandas, they may turn to other foods such as pumpkins, 
    kidney beans, eggs. fish, and even other small animals. Male pandas often weigh about 85-125kg (187.39- 275.57lbs), 
    while female pandas may weigh up to 70-100kg (154.32-220.46lbs). Despite its large weight and size, when a 
    panda cub is born, they roughly weigh 85-140 grams.
