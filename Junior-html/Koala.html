    The koala is an Australian animal often called the koala "bear". The koala can easily climb trees and is a 
    marsupial, which means a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring. When koalas are not sleeping, 
    they are usually eating. Their diets rely on eucalypyus trees which they also rely on for habitats. Eucalypyus 
    leaves are very toxic, which results in the koala's digestive system to work out in order for it to be digested. 
    This explains the reasoning to why koalas sleep for very long periods of time, their diets do not supply much energy
    for them.
