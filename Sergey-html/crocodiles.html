  <p>
    Crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia.
    The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes 
    the alligators and caimans, the gharial and false gharial among other extinct taxa.
